# CVRP

This folder contains the so-called "X instances" of Uchoa et al. (2017) and "XXL instances" of Arnold et al. (2019) for CVRP.
Downloaded from [CVRPLIB](http://vrp.atd-lab.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/).
The best-known solutions (BKS) reported in this directory follow the convention of rounding distances to the nearest integer.
The solution cost represents the total distance traveled.

> BKS in this folder are taken from CVRPLIB; please do not report new BKS to us!
