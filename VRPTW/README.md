# VRPTW

This folder contains the Gehring and Homberger VRPTW instances with 1000 customers.
The instances are taken from the [LKH-3 repository](http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH-3/).
The best-known solutions (BKS) reported in this directory follow the DIMACS rounding convention, that is, distances and durations are truncated to one decimal.
The solution cost represents the total distance traveled.

> BKS in this folder are taken from [CVRPLIB](http://vrp.atd-lab.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/); please do not report new BKS to us!
