# VRPB

VRP with backhaul instances of Queiroga et al. (2020).
Downloaded from [VRP-REP](http://www.vrp-rep.org/references/item/queiroga-et-al-2019.html) and modified to fit the VRPLIB format. 
This repository only includes the 90 largest VRPB instances, which we use for benchmarking PyVRP.
The other instances can be found in [this zip](https://github.com/PyVRP/PyVRP/files/14402701/VRPB.zip).
