# PC-CVRP

These small instances are based on the capacitated profitable tour problem (CPTP) instances of Bulhões et al. (2018).
They range in size from 50 to 200 customers and have been rewritten into VRPLIB format for PyVRP, but are otherwise identical to the instances studied there.
Instances in the original format can be downloaded [here](https://w1.cirrelt.ca/~vidalt/resources/instances-VRPSL.zip).
