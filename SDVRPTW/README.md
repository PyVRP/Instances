# SDVRPTW

This folder contains SDVRPTW instances from Cordeau et al. (2001) and Vidal et al. (2013).
Downloaded from [VRP-REP](http://www.vrp-rep.org/variants/item/sdvrptw-site-dependent.html) and modified to fit the VRPLIB format.
The best-known values are also extracted from the results tables of Vidal et al. (2013) and fit to the VRPLIB solution format, but without known routes.
