# SDVRPTW

This folder contains SDVRPTW instances from Cordeau and Laporte (2001) and Vidal et al. (2013).
The instances with `A` and `B` suffixes are from Vidal et al. (2013) and the others are from Cordeau and Laporte (2001).

Downloaded from [VRP-REP](http://www.vrp-rep.org/variants/item/sdvrptw-site-dependent.html) and modified to fit the VRPLIB format.

The BKS presented here align the routes with the vehicles: thus, "Route 1" corresponds to "Vehicle 1" in the instance data.
Similarly "Route 2" corresponds to "Vehicle 2", and so on.
In this way it is unambiguous which vehicle is supposed to execute which route.
