# SDVRPTW

This folder contains SDVRPTW instances from Vidal et al. (2013).
Downloaded from [VRP-REP](http://www.vrp-rep.org/datasets/item/2017-0017.html) and modified to fit the VRPLIB format.

The BKS presented here align the routes with the vehicles: thus, "Route 1" corresponds to "Vehicle 1" in the instance data.
Similarly "Route 2" corresponds to "Vehicle 2", and so on.
In this way it is unambiguous which vehicle is supposed to execute which route.
