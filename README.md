# Instances

Instances (in VRPLIB format) used to benchmark PyVRP.
For PyVRP-specific instances not found elsewhere we also provide and update the best-known solutions. 
See the directories of this repository for further information.
For questions and comments, please open an issue in the [main PyVRP repository](https://github.com/PyVRP/PyVRP).
