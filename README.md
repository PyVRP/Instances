# Instances

Instances used to benchmark PyVRP. 
These include the `X` and `GH1000` instances from [CVRPLIB](http://vrp.atd-lab.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/) for CVRP and VRPTW, as well as additional instances for other VRP variants.
To make this repository somewhat timeless, we only store the *instances*, not solutions.

For questions and comments, please open an issue in the [main PyVRP repository](https://github.com/PyVRP/PyVRP).
